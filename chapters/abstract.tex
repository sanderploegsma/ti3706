\textbf{Designing the future smart grid to replace the current electric power grid is a big step towards a more sustainable future of energy. Transforming the current electric power grid to an intelligent electric power distribution system introduces the need for advanced power management, communication and control techniques. In this paper, we identify two main challenges in the design of the smart grid: energy management and demand side management. We show that game theory is a promising tool to help solving these challenges, by surveying a number of applications based on game theory. In energy management the use of microgrid systems show promising results to help reduce the complexity encompassing the communication network between consumers and suppliers. Furthermore, we reveal that game theory-based applications for demand side management can increase efficiency of energy consumption by reducing total energy consumption or peak load in the electric power grid. Additionally, challenges in which game theory is difficult to apply are discussed. In other words, this survey provides an account of promising current game theoretic applications that can help providing a solution for challenges in making the current grid a much smarter grid.}
