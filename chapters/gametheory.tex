\section{Game theoretic tools for the development of smart grids}

\fb{As discussed before, it would be interessting to add a section 3.3 where you survey GT approafhes in Smart grids on a high level before diving into the two main topics in 4 and 5. The DEveloping Smart Grids” part is not covered in Section 3 so far. At least not in an obvious way. I would use 3.2. to intorduce these games more compactly and then 3.3. to explain how these models are used in Smart grids and then transit to 4. Seems more natural to me.

I am also missing a justification why the selection of chapter 4 and 5. I suggest to include this at the end. In the suggested Section 3.3.}

As seen in the previous chapters technical challenges arise with the introduction of smart grids. Game theory, in combination with methods from \ac{mas}, plays a significant role in the development of smart solutions for smart grids \cite{keypaper}. Game theory concepts provide us with a language to formulate, structure, analyse and understand strategic scenarios.

\subsection{What is game theory?}
\fb{Normal form game... Also give the tuple.}
Game theory is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision makers \cite{myerson2013game}.
We can define game theoretic games as following
\begin{itemize}
    \item a finite set $N$ (the set of players)
    \item for each player $i \in N$ a nonempty set $A_i$ (the set of actions available to player $i$)
    \item for each player $i \in N$ a payoff function $u_i: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ \fb{Say what A is... $A=A_1 x....A_{|N|}$ }
\end{itemize}

If the set $A_i$ of actions of every player $i$ is finite then the game is $finite$

The requirement that the preferences of each player $i$ be defined over A, rather than $A_{i}$, is the feature that distinguishes a strategic game from a decision problem: each \fb{care about others actions is not very nice….each player’s decision is usually affected by the decisions of other players.} player may care not only about his own action but also about the actions taken by the other players  \cite{CourseInGameTheory}.

\paragraph{Nash equilibrium} 
The most commonly used solution concept in game theory is that of Nash equilibrium. This notion captures a steady state of the play of a strategic game in which each player holds the correct expectation about the other players’ behaviour and acts rationally. It does not attempt to examine the process by which a steady state is reached.
The definition of a Nash equilibrium of a strategic game \fb{care about others actions is not very nice….each player’s decision is usually affected by the decisions of other players.} $\langle N, (A_i), (\succsim_i) \rangle $ is a profile $a^{*} \in A$ of actions with the property that for every player $i \in N$ we have $(a^{*}_{-i}, a^{*}_{i}) \succsim_i \mbox{ for all } a_i \in A_i$\fb{Doesnt make sense…something missing} 
Thus for $a^*$ \fb{explain notatation $a_i$ and $a_-i$}to be a Nash equilibrium it must be that no player $i$ has an action yielding an outcome that he prefers to that generated when he chooses $a_i^*$ , given that every other player $j$ chooses his equilibrium action $a^*_j$. Briefly, no player can profitably deviate, given the actions of the other players \cite{CourseInGameTheory}.


\paragraph{Computational challenge} 
It was not until recent, that researchers proved computing a Nash Equilibrium is complete for the complexity class PPAD\cite{daskalakis2009complexity}. This means that deciding if a \ac{neq} exists is a trivial question, as the answer of all PPAD problems is always yes, a solution always exists. Finding this solution though, cannot be NP-complete, as NP is a class of decision problems. But Daskalakis et al. informaly suggest finding a Nash problem is "as close to NP-complete as it could possibly be". \cite{daskalakis2009complexity, Aaronson2012}. 
As the computations being made by the smart agents will probably be done on low budget hardware, \ac{neq} need to be computed approximated with the use of Heuristics. \cite{MicrogridModellingPetrosAristidou,AumannGameTheoryAccomplish} 

\paragraph{Dominant actions}
In game theory, dominant actions (sometimes referred to as dominant strategy) are defined as actions that are strictly better for a certain player, no matter what actions all the other players perform. Games with dominant actions are usually easy, it is reasonable to assume that a dominant action is played. 

\paragraph{Cooperative vs. Non-cooperative game theory} 
Game theory can be divided into two main branches: non-cooperative game theory and cooperative game theory. Non-cooperative game theory is used in the strategic decision-making processes of a number of entities that are independent in their decision making, and have a partially or totally conflicting interest over the outcome of a decision process that is affected by their actions\cite{keypaper}. In cooperative game theory, it is possible to model binding agreements between entities and strategies can be shared. 

It is important to note that non-cooperative does not always imply that the players are not competing, any cooperation that arises must be self-enforcing with no communication or coordination of strategic choices among the players.

\paragraph{Prisoner's Dilemma}
One of the most famous examples that illustrates a situation that can be modelled by game theory is the Prisoner's Dilemma. This is an example which was formalised by Poundstone \cite{poundstone} and goes as follows: 

Two suspects of a crime are arrested and imprisoned separately. If they both confess, each will be convicted to go to jail for 2 years. If only 1 suspect confesses, he wil be used as a witness against the other suspect. The witness wil be set free, the other suspect wil go to jail for 3 years. If they both remain silent, both of them will only serve 1 year in prison. This game can be formalised by $\langle N, (A_i), (u_i) \rangle$as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $N = \{i_{1}, i_{2} \}$ the suspects are the players.
    \item $A_1 = A_2 = \{S, C\}$, silent and confess.
    \item $u_1(S, S) = u_2(S, S) = 1$, \\
    $u_1(C, C) = u_2(C, C) = 2$, \\
    $u_1(S, C) = u_2(C, S) = 3$, \\
    $u_1(C, S) = u_2(S, C) = 0$.

\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
                             & silent                   & confess                   \\ \cline{2-3} 
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{silent}  & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{1,1} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{0,3} \\ \cline{2-3} 
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{confess} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{3,0} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2,2} \\ \cline{2-3} 
\end{tabular}
\caption{Prisoners dilemma options}
\label{prisoners-d}
\end{table}

In Table \ref{prisoners-d} you see all options for the prisoner's dilemma modelled in an easier to read payoff matrix. If the prisoners want the total number of years in prison to be as low as possible, they should both be silent. Interesting however is that each player has an incentive to confess. With the given prisoners dilemma example we have to following situation: No matter what is chosen by one player, the other player benefits to confess. This is why the Nash equilibrium for this game is (Confess, Confess). This is a good example of a dominant strategy. 

\subsection{Examples of commonly used game theoretical concepts}
\fb{The following is a bit “boring”. I suggest to at least compress it and make it more interesting by removing the paragraph structure and somehow write it with a more story behind. E.g.: In contrast to to normal form games where players take a single action, extensive form games allow to model sequential decision making… etc.}
In this subsection we will briefly discuss some game theory concepts used in the following chapters. 

\paragraph{Mechanism design}
The standard game theory procedure is to formulate a model that
captures a situation and to investigate the set of outcomes that are
consistent with some solution concept \cite{CourseInGameTheory}. In the making of game theory models for the smart grid, this isn't always sufficient. This is because the number of players (energy consumers and energy suppliers) is large and constantly changing, and therefor also the supply and demand of energy. This is where mechanism design comes in. In mechanism design, or reversed game theory, we do exactly the opposite as in the standard game theory procedure. We first define the goal we want to achieve, and then analyse what procedures can be designed to achieve those goals \cite{SalfatiRabinovici2014}. 

\paragraph{Auctions}
Auctions are often used in models to decide for what price power should be bought or sold. First-price auctions are auctions where bidders submit bids, and the highest bidder wins and pays the winning bid. Second-price auctions are auctions where also the highest bidder wins, but where the bidder pays a price equal to the second highest bid. Second-price bids are for example used in \cite{SaadHanPoorEtAl2011} because this type of auction is strategy proof, i.e., it gives the involved entities an incentive to truthfully reveal their bids. The second-price auctions are also called \ac{vcg} auctions or VCG-auctions, named after the author of the paper that introduced this this concept \cite{Vickrey1961}.

\paragraph{\ac{agv} mechanism}
An \ac{agv} mechanism is comparable to \ac{vcg}-auctions with main difference that VCG has the ex interim individual rationality property, and AGV has the ex ante individual rationality property\cite{ShohamLeyton-Brown2008}. This means that an agent in the VCG mechanism knows his own type but not the types of the other agents. An agent in an \ac{agv} mechanism knows nothing about anyone’s actual type. \todo{Explain difference focused on idividual rationality and budget balance.}

\paragraph{Stochastic games}
A stochastic game is a dynamic play that proceeds from position to position \cite{Shapley1953} and can be played by one or more players. Quite a few papers have been written with stochastic games in the smart grid \cite{LiangZhuang2014} because they are good to characterize the randomness in renewable power generation.  

\paragraph{Bayesian games}
Bayesian games are a non-cooperative game type where the information about the strategies and objective function of the other players is incomplete. Given the large nature of the smart grid, the amount of players involved, it is quite possible that players in any game model might face technical difficulties in estimating the strategies or objectives of the other players \cite{keypaper}. With this in mind, bayesian games can overcome a lot of these difficulties.

\paragraph{Game of perfect information}
\fb{Never referred to them as games of perfect information.}
Games of perfect information or extensive games of perfect information deal with the type of games that have a sequential structure, and assuming that each player has knowledge about the previous actions of other players \cite{CourseInGameTheory}.

\paragraph{Stackelberg games}
A Stackelberg game is a game of perfect information. \cite{CourseInGameTheory}.
In a Stackelberg game there is a player who takes on the role of the \textit{leader} and another player who is the \textit{follower}. The leader will then try to enforce its strategy onto the follower \cite{ShohamLeyton-Brown2008}. The follower is informed of the action chosen by the leader and will then proceed to choose its own action.

\paragraph{Congestion games}
A congestion game is a special case of a potential game \cite{IbarsNavarroGiupponi2010, MondererShapley1996, ShohamLeyton-Brown2008} in which players choose actions based on the the amount of other players picking some resource. This means that the payoff of each player is determined by the frequency of a resource being picked. As a result, there is an anonymity property present. This property states that players have no interest in exactly who selects the resource, only how many \cite{ShohamLeyton-Brown2008}.
