\section{Game Theory applied to Smart Grids}
When researching Game Theoretic approaches to manage and run Smart Grids, one will find out that a distinction can be made for different kind of subproblems arising in smart-grids research.\cite{keypaper}. In this paper the focus is on microgrids and demand side management. Both very interesting subsets of smartgrids, each with it's own challenges and smart solutions. First the microgrids are discussed, which can help tackle complex challenges and solve efficiency issues. Secondly the Demand side management(DMS) is discussed. Demand side Management will help in locating and solving issues involving the end user.
