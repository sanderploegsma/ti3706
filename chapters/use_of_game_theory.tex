\section{Game Theory applied to Smart Grids}
When researching game theoretic approaches to manage and run Smart Grids, one will find out that a distinction can be made for different kind of subproblems arising in smart-grids research \cite{keypaper}. In this paper the focus lies on the use of microgrids and the demand side management. First the microgrids are discussed, which can help tackle complex challenges and solve efficiency issues. Secondly the \gls{dms} is discussed. \gls{dms} will help in locating and solving issues involving the end user.
