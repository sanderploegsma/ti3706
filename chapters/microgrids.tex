\section{Microgrids}
Dividing the smart-grid into subgrids is a logical thing to do, as current electricity grids, while they're just a one-way communication, are already split up. \todo{Needs citations} See the "verdeelkastjes" \fix{Verdeelkastjes?} which can be seen in every neighbourhood. Besides having a great structure with less risks [citation needed], dividing smart-grids into sub-grids and eventually microgrids \todo{Explain the differences between sub-grids and microgrids or remove} has even more advantages. \todo{Citations needed!} Microgrids make use of so called \glspl{vpp}. First \glspl{vpp} will be addressed before game theoretic techniques are \todo{translate: uiteengezet} for the use and \todo{translate: nut} of microgrids. \improve{Not satisfied with this introduction}

\subsection{\acrlongpl{vpp}}
When researching \glspl{vpp} and their use in microgrids, no definitive definition can be found for a \gls{vpp}. A nice view is given by Mashhour et al. \cite{MashhourMoghaddas-Tafreshi2011} and Nikonowicz et al. \cite{NikonowiczMilewski2012}. Some definitions could even been seen as a simple version of a microgrid, aggregating and controlling a whole neighbourhood \cite{Kumagai2012} and thus making the difference between a microgrid and a \gls{vpp} only a thin line. For the convenience of the use of \glspl{vpp} in microgrids, we stick to the following definition:

A \gls{vpp} is a control center or an aggregation of (different kinds) energy sources, such as renewable and nonrenewable generators, and will appear onto the market as if it is only \'one power plant. It keeps track of it's energy sources' supplies and determines the price. Communication for it's energy sources is directed to the VPP, which determines it's price according to its supply and the demand. VPP's can be very efficient, as they can combine different energy sources to generate a continuous supply. In other words, resources with different weaknesses and strengths are combined in a complementary way \cite{Koeppel2003}. For example, when a wind turbine and solar cells are combined, the VPP's is less subject to changing weather conditions. \cite{Tromly2001, Kumagai2012, MashhourMoghaddas-Tafreshi2011, NikonowiczMilewski2012}

\glspl{vpp} are widely used in microgrids, as they make pricing of electricity for a combination of (closely located) energy sources pretty convenient. \todo{elaborate why microgrids are used commonly in microgrids}

\subsection{Efficiency for microgrids}

\subsection{Game of perfect information}
When using microgrids, a game theory called \emph{a dynamic game of perfect information} \todo{ Explain what this game method is} can be used to create an equilibrium in microgrids. Because the number of players is limited in a microgrid, both for the demand side as well as the supply side within a microgrid, it is less complex and time consuming to calculate the best options considering each players' wishes. Then, a price can be determined by a Aggregator, who can decide whether to buy or sell electricity for the whole microgrid \cite{MicrogridModellingPetrosAristidou}.

\subsection{Localised microgrids vs Virtual microgrids}
\todo{find good paper for this difference}
Energy loss reduction is one of the advantages when using microgrids in a smart way. Power waste is mainly do two two factors \cite{EnergyLossURL}: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Power transmission from energy plants to local distributors, is done trough power lines, having losses due to for example heat.
\item Transformers. Each transformer has a certain efficiency, which is never 100\%. The less transformers, the less energy loss.
\end{enumerate}

Microgrids will be able to reduce the waste of power because within microgrids generated power can be used for local demand and can communicate with other nearby microgrids. Besides it can help avoid the power losses in substation's transformers \cite{keypaper}.
