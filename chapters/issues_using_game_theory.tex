\section{Issues expected when using Game Theory}


\subsection{Scalability}
(is the game applicable on a large scale or only in a small local market?)
\subsection{Interoperability}
(how does the game do in multiple contexts, f.e. in context of DER?)
\subsection{Realism}
(is the representation of the game realistic in a real world application?)
