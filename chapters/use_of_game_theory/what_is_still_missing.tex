Issues expected when using Game Theory

Using the following terms:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Scalability (is the game applicable on a large scale or only in a small local market?)
	\item Interoperability (how does the game do in multiple contexts, f.e. in context of DER?)
	\item Realism (is the representation of the game realistic in a real world application?)
\end{itemize}
